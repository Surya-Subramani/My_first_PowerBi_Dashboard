# 🎬 Netflix Power BI Dashboard 🍿

### *My First Power BI Project – Data Meets Binge-Watching!*

Hey there! 👋
Welcome to my **first-ever Power BI project** — a fun dive into the world of **Netflix data**!
I wanted to explore what makes our favorite streaming giant tick 📺 — so I built a **Power BI dashboard** packed with cool visuals, insights, and (of course) a lot of red and black vibes.

## 📊 What’s Inside?

Here’s what my dashboard shows:

* 🌍 **Top 10 Countries** by total number of Movies & TV Shows
* 🎥 **Total Movies** vs 📺 **Total TV Shows**
* 📅 Visuals showing **content distribution trends**
* 🎬 **Genre breakdowns** to see what dominates Netflix’s catalog

All neatly arranged into one interactive dashboard that tells the story of Netflix’s global content empire!

## 🧠 What I Learned

Since this was my **first Power BI project**, I picked up some awesome skills along the way:

* Connecting and transforming data in Power BI Desktop
* Designing clean, engaging visuals
* Using filters, slicers, and color themes effectively
* Publishing my dashboard to the Power BI Service (hello, cloud world ☁️!)

## 🛠 Tools Used

* **Power BI Desktop** – to design and visualize
* **Power BI Service** – to publish and share
* **Netflix Titles Dataset** (from Kaggle) – the star of the show

## 💡 Future Ideas

Because why stop here?

* Add **time-series analysis** for release trends 📅
* Include **rating distribution** and **duration analysis**
* Build a mini **recommendation engine dashboard** next 👀
